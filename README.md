# **SOFE3650 Project - Social Calendar**

This project is based on the SOFE2720 Final Project, found here: https://github.com/SOFE2720/Social-Calendar-Group-12

The old README can be found [here](https://github.com/madlitch/SOFE3650-Project/blob/main/README_OLD.md)

## Introduction

Attempting to organize and plan events with friends is always a hassle especially when no one knows when anyone else is available. Our new Social Calendar aims to make event planning infinitely easier by allowing you to see your friendsâ€™ public events and sending out invites to new events. Social Calendar provides a lightweight user-friendly package for all your planning needs.
