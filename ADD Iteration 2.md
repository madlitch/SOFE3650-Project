# ADD Iteration 2

## 2.1 Establish Iteration Goal by Selecting Drivers

Other than CRN-2, we will be considering following use cases as they are integral to the functionality of the product:
- UC-1
- UC-3
- UC-4
- UC-5
- UC-6

## 2.2 Refine System Elements

The elements to be refined in this iteration are the modules located in the different layers defined by the reference architectures we chose in the previous iteration: Rich Client Application and Service Application. As we chose a three-tier deployment, each component and associated modules must function together, otherwise the product would not be functional.

## 2.3 Select One or More Design Concepts that Satisfy the Selected Drivers

| Design Decisions and Location        | Rationale and Assumptions           |
| ------------- |-------------| 
| Create a Domain Model for the Application     | Before starting the decomposition, we must create an initial domain model for the system. There are no good alternatives  | 
| Identify Domain Objects that map to functional requirements      | Each element of the application needs to be encapsulated in a domain object block.     |   
| Decompose Domain Objects into general and specialized Components |  The domain objects would be complete sets of functionality, supported by smaller modules found within. Decomposition would be achieved through the specialization of the internal modules of the domain objects.   |
| Use SQLAlchemy | SQLAlchemy is a Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper. Other ORM frameworks were not considered as the development team was already familiar with SQLAlchemy.    |

## 2.4 Instantiate Architectural Elements, Allocate Responsibilities, and Define Interfaces

| Design Decisions and Location        | Rationale           |
| ------------- |-------------| 
| Create only an initial domain model |Entities that participate in the primary use cases need to be identified and modelled, however, only an initial domain model is created, to accelerate this phase of design.| 
|Map the system use cases to domain object|Identification of domain objects can be done by analyzing systemâ€™s use cases. To address CRN-2, domain objects are identified for all of the use cases, UC-1 to UC-6.| 
|Decompose the domain objects across the layers to identify layer-specific modules with an explicit interface |This will ensure that the modules who support all of the functionalities are identified. | 
| Associate frameworks with a module in the data layer |  The ORM mapping is found in the data access module in the data layer. The SQLAlchemy framework is associated with this module.| 

## 2.5 Sketch Views and Record Design Decisions

 ** SKETCHES **

| Element        | Responsibility           |
| ------------- |-------------| 
|CalendarView| Displays current calendar and updates it when settings are changed or when events are added/removed.| 
| CalendarController | This element is responsible for providing the presentation layer information to display the current calendar. | 
| RequestManager | Responsible for communication with the server-side logic. | 
| RequestService | Responsible for providing a facade that takes requests from clients | 
| DomainEntities | Contains the entities from the domain model (server side). | 
| TopologyController|Contains business logic related to the topological information. | 
| EventController | Contains business logic related to management of events.|
| UserController | Contains user data information | 
| EventDataMapper | Responsible for persistence operations (CRUD) related to the events | 
| UserDataMapper | Responsible for persistence operations (CRUD) related to the users |
