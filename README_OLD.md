# **Social Calendar**

## Introduction

Attempting to organize and plan events with friends is always a hassle especially when no one knows when anyone else is available. Our new Social Calendar aims to make event planning infinitely easier by allowing you to see your friendsâ€™ public events and sending out invites to new events. Social Calendar provides a lightweight user-friendly package for all your planning needs.
